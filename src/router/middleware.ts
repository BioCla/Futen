   * Middleware allows you to run code before a request is completed.
   * Then, based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers,
   * or responding directly.
   *
   * Middleware runs before cached content and routes are matched. See Matching Paths for more details.
   *
   * * Returning a `Response` from middleware will prevent the route from being called
   * and will instead return the response from the middleware.
   *
   * * Returning a `Request` from middleware will modify the request and continue to the route.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * ⁣const server = new Server([
   *  Home,
   *  Convert
   * ], {
   *   middleware: (request) => {
   *   console.log(`Request to ${request.url}`);
   *  }
   * });

   * @note If the path is not specified, the middleware will run on all paths.
   * @note Matching is done using a wildcard match.
