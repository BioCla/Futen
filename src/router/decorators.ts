/**
 * The route decorator assigns a path to a class within the server it is applied to.
 *
 * It does this by wrapping the class in a Route class, which is then used to generate the server's routes.
 * However, this does NOT mean that the class is directly converted to a Route class. This means that you cannot use
 * properties or methods of the Route class directly on the class itself.
 *
 * For example, you can do this:
 * ```ts
 * ⁣@route("/")
 * class Home {
 *  get() {
 *   return Response.json({ "message": "Hello, world!" });
 *  }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * -----
 *
 * but using something like `this.path` will not work.
 * ```ts
 * ⁣@route("/")
 * class Home {
 *  get() {
 *   return Response.json({ "message": `Hello, world! You are at ${this.path}` }); // ⛔️ This will NOT work
 *  }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You need to access that property from the server.
 * ```ts
 * ⁣@route("/")
 * class Home {
 *  get() {
 *   return Response.json({ "message": `Hello, world! You are at ${server.routes.Home.path}` }); // ✅ This will work
 *  }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param path The path to assign to the class
 * @returns A class decorator
