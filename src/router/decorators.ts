/**
 * The route decorator assigns a path to a class within the server it is applied to.
 *
 * It does this by wrapping the class in a Route class, which is then used to generate the server's routes.
 * However, this does NOT mean that the class is directly converted to a Route class. This means that you cannot use
 * properties or methods of the Route class directly on the class itself.
 *
 * For example, you can do this:
 * ```ts
 * ⁣@route("/")
 * class Home {
 *  get() {
 *   return Response.json({ "message": "Hello, world!" });
 *  }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * -----
 *
 * but using something like `this.path` will not work.
 * ```ts
 * ⁣@route("/")
 * class Home {
 *  get() {
 *   return Response.json({ "message": `Hello, world! You are at ${this.path}` }); // ⛔️ This will NOT work
 *  }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You need to access that property from the server.
 * ```ts
 * ⁣@route("/")
 * class Home {
 *  get() {
 *   return Response.json({ "message": `Hello, world! You are at ${server.routes.Home.path}` }); // ✅ This will work
 *  }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param path The path to assign to the class
 * @returns A class decorator

/**
 * Decorator to add middleware to a single route
 *
 * Adding multiple decorators is possible, in which case they will be executed in the order they are written.
 * (i.e. the first decorator will be the first middleware to be executed)
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Executes arbitrary code before the route is called
 *
 * @param middleware - The middleware to apply to the route
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```ts
 * function logger(request: Request) {
 *  console.log(`Request to ${request.url}`)
 * }
 *
 * ⁣@middleware(logger)
 * ⁣@route("/")
 * class Home {
 *   get() {
 *     return Response.json({ "message": "Hello, world!" });
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * You can also apply multiple middleware to a single route by passing an array of middleware
 * and they will be executed in the order they are passed.
 * @example
 *
 * ```ts
 * ⁣@middleware([(request) => {
 * console.log(`Request to ${request.url}`)
 * }, (request) => {
 * console.log(`Request to ${request.url} - The Second`)
 * }])
 * ⁣@route("/")
 * class Home {
 *   get() {
 *     return Response.json({ "message": "Hello, world!" });
 *   }
