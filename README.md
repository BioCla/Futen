### **Get started with:**

```sh
bun init

bun i futen
```

```ts
import { HTTPServer, route } from "futen";

@route("/")
class Index {
  get() {
    return new Response("Hello, World!");
  }
}

const server = new HTTPServer({
  Index
})

console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${server.instance.port}`);
```

```ts
import { HTTPServer, route } from "futen";

@route("/")
class Index {
  // `get` is a special method keyword for classes on which a futen decorator has been applied to, see below
  get() {
    return new Response("Hello, World!");
  }
}

const server = new HTTPServer({
  Index
})

console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${server.instance.port}`);
```

## Know how

`route` defines an HTTP/REST route class which reserves the following methods as "keywords":
- `get`
- `head`
- `post`
- `put`
- `delete`
- `connect`
- `options`
- `trace`
- `patch`

`ws`, similarly to the `route` decorator, reserves WebSocket event "keywords", which are documented in the [Bun websocket docs](https://bun.sh/docs/api/websockets#reference), directly referencing the following methods:
- `message`
- `open`
- `close`
- `drain`
- `ping`
- `pong`

To see how they could be used check out the [examples](./examples/)
